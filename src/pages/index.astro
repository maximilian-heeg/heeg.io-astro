    Heeg.IO - Maximilian Heeg -
    Welcome to my personal website! I am a pediatrician with a passion for
    understanding the complexities of the immune system. My research is focused
    on CD8<sup>+</sup> tissue-resident memory T cells, or TRM cells for
    short. These cells are critical for protecting our bodies against infections
    and diseases, and I am fascinated by how they form and interact with other cells
    in the body. To study TRM cells, I work with a mouse model of LCMV
    Armstrong infection. This model allows me to investigate the formation and function
    of TRM cells in response to viral infection. By infecting mice with
    this virus, I can study the formation of TRM cells in response to
    viral infection, and how these cells contribute to long-term immunity to the
    virus.

    Hi, I am a pediatrician with a passion for
    understanding the complexities of the immune system. My research is focused
    on CD8<sup>+</sup> tissue-resident memory T cells, or T<sub>RM</sub> cells for
    short. These cells are critical for protecting our bodies against infections
    and diseases, and I am fascinated by how they form and interact with other cells
    in the body.

    <p>
      When I'm not immersed in research, I enjoy spending time exploring the
      mountains with my Goldendoodle companion.

  <h3>Unveiling the Secrets of Tissue-Specific Immunity</h3>
  <p class="onscroll-fade-in">
    I leverage the power of bioinformatics, specifically single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)
    and spatial transcriptomics, to delve into the fascinating world of T cell adaptation to
    diverse tissue environments. These advanced techniques allow me to map the gene
    expression profiles of individual cells, providing a high-resolution view of the
    immune response at the tissue level.
  </p>

  <p class="onscroll-fade-in">
    One of the challenges in studying T<sub>RM</sub> cells is that they are difficult
    to isolate and study in the lab. However, with the development of spatial transcriptomics,
    we can now analyze individual T<sub>RM</sub> cells and study their gene expression
    patterns in great detail.

  <h3>Decoding the Language of Immunity: My Computational Toolkit</h3>
  <p>
  Beyond the wet lab, I'm passionate about using code to crack the code of the
  immune system. Python and R are my go-to languages for wrangling complex
  biological data and extracting hidden patterns.  Always on the lookout
  for new tools, I'm currently exploring the potential of Rust, a fun journey, but I am
  still lacking a good usecase. :-)
